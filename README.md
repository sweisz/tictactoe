This is a modified starter code for the official [React.js tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). All components are using React hooks instead of class components and are based on TypeScript. Please follow the [Hooks tutorial](https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/tutorial/tutorial.html) instead of the official tutorial.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Great, you are ready to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the components by modifying `components/Game.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
